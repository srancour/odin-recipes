The Odin Project Recipes Project

This is a basic recipe website that is meant to practice the HTML knowledge I have acquired thus far through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Skills practiced:
- creating a html page from boilerplate
- linking pages
- adding in images
- unordered lists
- ordered lists
- heading structure
- git commands
